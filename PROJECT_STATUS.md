# Feature Status

Honest classification from a read-only code verification pass. Tiers:
**Implemented** = working end-to-end · **Partial** = UI/flow present but core logic incomplete · **Placeholder** = entry point exists, capability not yet built.

## Implemented
- Home / Entry screen
- Premium dashboard (My Garden)
- Calendar (v14-style: month nav, notes, day details)
- Notifications (preferences + optional browser notification)
- Health Score (`calculateHealthScore`)
- Add Plant popover (Scan / Manual / Smart Recommendations / Garden Design sources)
- Plant cards
- Smart Recommendations (climate/tag filtering + live profile enrichment)
- Multi-language support (EN/HE, RTL/LTR)
- Mobile support (mobile-first responsive)
- GitHub integration
- Netlify deployment (functions present)

## Partial
- Plant Doctor — plant **identification** and care recommendations work (`plant-identify.mjs`, plant-identifier module, `visual_analysis`); structured **disease detection / diagnosis** is not yet a real flow.
- Shop / Cart — cart add/remove/quantity work; **checkout is a stub** (`checkoutDemo()` shows a "ready for Shopify connection" alert) and there is **no Order flow**.
- Garden photo — hero photo upload works (`scanGarden`); per-plant photo replacement is a stub (`replacePlantPhoto`).

## Placeholder
- Garden Design — only a tag-filtered plant-add source (`addPlantFromDesign`). The `ARCHITECTURE.md` capabilities (photo upload, AI garden redesign, garden styles, plant placement) are **not implemented**.

> Note: tiering reflects code as verified during this audit. Update tiers as modules progress (see Update Rules).

---

# Current Baseline

The approved baseline is:

- My Garden v20-v14-calendar-merged — `TODO(baseline-ref)`: add the commit/tag that pins this baseline.
- v14 Calendar
- v19 Add Plant popover
- Current dashboard layout
- Current mobile UI

These must never be replaced unless explicitly approved. Once a new design is approved in Figma, it becomes the new baseline for that screen (see `AGENTS.md` → "Design source of truth").

---

# Active Development

### Next phase — read-only planning (decision pending; no implementation yet)
Status: **Next — planning only**  
Priority: High  
Scope: choose the next **small** phase after Location Reliability Enforcement — **read-only inspection and plan only**; do not implement until explicitly approved

**Option A — Confidence-aware scoring refinements (beyond location gate):** read-only plan for consuming `climateConfidence` and `weatherStatus` (and related confidence notes) in suitability/SR engines — conservative caps and reasons when weather is stale/missing or climate confidence is low; location trust gating is already enforced (see Location Reliability Enforcement). No UI redesign in planning phase.

**Option B — Product/Care Schedule runtime planning:** read-only plan for Treatment Calendar task runtime, purchase/use task linking, and outcome feedback on garden `data` (schema committed `416fc78`; runtime not wired). Product recommendations must still require a trusted user location per Location Reliability Plan.

**Option C — Catalog validation / import pipeline planning:** read-only plan for seed/catalog validation, import workflow, and quality-tier gates before larger batch enrichment.  

**Catalog / climate strategy note:** v1a → v1b → v1c-loader → v1d climateTraits bridge → Climate Risk / Frost Scoring Refinement (`4092627`) → Smart Recommendations catalog climate bridge (`deae8db`) → Location / Weather Reliability confidence metadata (`a94b3fa`) → **Location Reliability Enforcement (done — see plan below)** → next small phase (decision pending) → batch enrichment → on-demand missing profiles → backend/database migration.

# Known Issues

### System default location used for recommendations (implementation gap)
Description: `ensureGardenLocation()` still seeds `DEFAULT_GARDEN_LOCATION` (Western Galilee) when no user location exists, but that fallback is **no longer trusted** for suitability, Smart Rec, or weather-care paths.
Priority: High  
Status: **Fixed** — Location Reliability Enforcement gates all recommendation and weather-care paths on `hasTrustedAppLocation()`; Western Galilee remains internal crash-prevention only
Files: `index.html` (`hasTrustedAppLocation`, climate suitability, Smart Rec, weather tasks / refresh)
Notes: Existing location UI and `DEFAULT_GARDEN_LOCATION` unchanged; see Location Reliability Plan / Enforcement below.

Local runtime tests passed (default/untrusted, confirmed manual location, location reset); no console errors observed. |

# Strategic Principle

**CRUVIT is a Garden Operating System / Digital Twin centered on My Garden.**

Do not build isolated modules or jump to Garden Design redesign too early. The hard-to-copy value is **connected user garden data**:

location · climate · personal plant library · photos · tasks · diagnosis · recommendations · design selections · wishlist · purchases · **product outcome memory**

Every roadmap phase should strengthen that shared garden data layer before expanding module-specific UI.

**Location trust rule:** A user's **confirmed** garden location is core garden data. System/internal fallback coordinates (e.g. Western Galilee) are not user garden data and must never drive confident recommendations. See **Location Reliability Plan** below.

---

# Location Reliability Plan

**Hard requirement:** CRUVIT must **never silently use a generic system default location** (such as Western Galilee) for real plant suitability, Smart Recommendations, care tasks, or product recommendations.

### Location requirement

- On **first use**, the app must ask the user to **set or confirm** their garden location.
- The user can choose **current location** (GPS/browser) or **manually enter** a city/location.
- After the user **confirms a location once**, that saved user-specific location becomes the user's **personal default** for future sessions.
- The system must distinguish:
  1. **System/internal fallback location** — technical/dev fallback only; prevents crashes; **not trusted**
  2. **User-confirmed saved location** — the only location trusted for recommendations
- Only a **user-confirmed saved location** may be treated as trusted for recommendations.

### Trusted location criteria (enforced)

`hasTrustedAppLocation()` returns true only when **all** of the following hold:

- `confirmationStatus === 'confirmed'`
- `source !== 'default'`
- `locationConfidence !== 'default'`

Western Galilee / `DEFAULT_GARDEN_LOCATION` may still be seeded by `ensureGardenLocation()` for crash prevention, but it is **not** a trusted user location and must not drive recommendations.

### If no confirmed user location exists

- Do **not** give confident plant suitability recommendations.
- Do **not** treat Western Galilee or any other generic fallback as the user's real location.
- Smart Recommendations must be **gated, limited, or clearly marked** as requiring location confirmation.
- Climate-based care tasks and product recommendations must **not** be generated confidently.
- The app must **prompt the user to set/confirm location** (existing location chip / modal / Smart Rec location step — no new UI).

### Enforcement (implemented)

| Area | Behavior when location is untrusted |
|------|-------------------------------------|
| Climate suitability | `level: 'unknown'`, `score: null`, `dataSource: 'location_untrusted'`, summary from `requireTrustedAppLocationReason()`, warning `"Location not confirmed."` |
| Smart Rec scoring | `smartRecEvaluateSuitability()` → blocked / score `0` with location-required reason |
| Smart Rec browse | `getSmartRecBrowsePlants()` returns `[]` (no trusted climate-ranked results from fallback) |
| Smart Rec confirm | `smartRecConfirmLocation()` opens existing location modal; cannot confirm Western Galilee/default as real location |
| Weather care tasks | `syncWeatherCareTasks()` returns without creating frost/heat/weather tasks from fallback |
| Weather refresh | `refreshGardenSession()` / `refreshGardenWeatherIfStale()` fetch weather only when `hasTrustedAppLocation()` is true |
| Fallback / UI | `ensureGardenLocation()` + `DEFAULT_GARDEN_LOCATION` kept for crash prevention; existing location UI unchanged |

**Code scope:** Only `index.html` application code changed for enforcement. No modules, data files, schemas, styles, or UI markup changes.

**Local runtime tests:** Passed for default/untrusted location, confirmed manual location (e.g. London), and location reset; dashboard still renders; no console errors observed.

### Implementation principle

- A fallback location may exist only as an **internal technical/dev fallback** to prevent crashes.
- It must be marked `locationConfidence: "default"` (or equivalent) and must **not** be used as trusted recommendation input.
- Confidence metadata (`a94b3fa`) plus Location Reliability Enforcement (above) cover the location-trust gate; further **confidence-aware scoring refinements** (e.g. stale weather / low `climateConfidence` caps) remain optional follow-on work. Product recommendation runtime is still unwired and must also respect trusted location when built.

### Current state vs remaining work

| Area | Current (enforcement done) | Remaining |
|------|----------------------------|-----------|
| Climate profile | Exposes `locationConfidence: "default"` for unconfirmed fallback | — |
| Suitability / SR scoring | Gated on `hasTrustedAppLocation()` | Optional caps for stale/low confidence weather/climate |
| Smart Rec browse/sort | Empty / blocked until trusted location | — |
| Weather care tasks / refresh | Skipped until trusted location | — |
| Product recommendations | Not yet wired | No confident product recs without confirmed location + care need |

**Status:** Hard requirement **enforced** in application code (`index.html`). Western Galilee remains internal fallback only. `GAS-2` location control + existing location UI unchanged. Further confidence-aware refinements and product-rec gating are separate follow-on work.

### Phase notes (brief)

- **4 — Climate Suitability Engine v1:** done through v1b — snapshot helpers (`a7f6df6`) and climate-only `evaluateClimateSuitabilityV1()` (`c8a76bc`) without rewriting SR rules. **v1e frost refinement done (`4092627`):** `climateSuitabilityV1IsFrostFreeGrowingClimate()` + conservative penalties and level caps in `climateSuitabilityV1FromSnapshot()` only — high frost-sensitive tropical/warm plants (e.g. coconut, papaya, banana, mango) no longer receive optimistic `good` when scored against unconfirmed internal fallback Mediterranean profile; frost warnings and `notRecommended`/`risky` outcomes when frost-free climate is not clear; lavender and olive remain `good` in confirmed Mediterranean conditions; `indoorShelter: true` lifts/reduces conservative cap for protected/indoor growing. **Runtime tests passed:** coconut/papaya/banana/mango `notRecommended` with frost warning; lavender/olive `good`; coconut + `indoorShelter` → `good`; no console errors; My Garden/tasks dashboard renders.
- **5 — Global Plant Catalog Foundation v1:** scalable global knowledge base before deep Per-user Plant Library work. **v1a done (`63b50c4`):** schema shell + legacy bridge helpers. **v1b done (`1d540f0`):** 32 curated seed plants in `data/plants.seed.json`. **v1c-loader done (`b6c4c39`):** non-blocking async loader. **v1d done (`61cdfed`):** climateTraits bridge — seed `climateTraits` on flat objects; `getPlantClimateMetadata()` prefers SMART_REC then catalog traits. **SR catalog climate bridge done (`deae8db`):** Smart Recommendations uses catalog `climateTraits` when SMART_REC metadata is missing; SMART_REC remains first priority for inline plants; frost parity + needsReview conservative ranking; coconut/papaya/banana/mango borderline when climate profile uses unconfirmed fallback (internal Western Galilee — **not** an endorsed user default); lavender/olive unchanged. **Location / Weather Reliability confidence metadata done (`a94b3fa`):** `smartRecClimateProfile()` / `getAppClimateProfile()` expose additive reliability metadata — `structuralFreezingRisk`, `forecastFreezingRisk`, `isFrostFreeGrowingClimate`, `locationConfidence`, `climateConfidence`, `weatherStatus`, `weatherAgeMs`, `confidenceNotes`; `data.weatherFetchError` set on weather fetch failure and cleared on success; default/unconfirmed location surfaced as `locationConfidence: "default"`. **Location Reliability Enforcement done (`index.html` only):** `hasTrustedAppLocation()` requires `confirmationStatus === 'confirmed'`, `source !== 'default'`, and `locationConfidence !== 'default'`; Western Galilee / `DEFAULT_GARDEN_LOCATION` remains internal crash-prevention only (not trusted); untrusted suitability → `unknown` / `score: null` / `location_untrusted`; Smart Rec scoring/browse blocked until real location confirmed; weather care tasks and weather refresh blocked until trusted; existing location UI and fallback mechanisms unchanged; no modules/data/schema/styles/UI markup changes; local tests passed (default/untrusted, confirmed manual, reset); no console errors. **Next (planning only):** confidence-aware scoring refinements (stale/low climate/weather confidence) **or** Product/Care Schedule runtime planning **or** catalog validation/import pipeline planning — decision pending. Then: batch enrichment → on-demand missing profiles → backend/API migration.
- **6 — Per-user Plant Library v1:** user's saved/catalog plants as first-class data; still separate from global catalog mutations.
- **7 — Shared Plant Picker v1:** one picker UX/data path for Add Plant, Smart Rec, Design — after catalog + library foundations are stable.
- **8 — Garden Photo / Media Library:** garden and plant media tied to `data`, not module-local blobs.
- **9–10 — Identifier / Smart Rec integration:** wire modules through shared plant + climate layer; preserve existing detection/scoring quality.
- **11 — Garden Design visual upgrade:** plant visuals only; not full Studio redesign.
- **12 — Wishlist:** filter/status inside Plant Library; no parallel wishlist store.
- **13 — Shopify Smart Connection:** real product catalog, cart/checkout, and **User Product Outcome Memory** (see Product Commerce plan below). Product recommendations must flow from Treatment Calendar (`treatmentId`) — never random.
- **13–15 — Shopify, Design Studio 2.0, AI Coach:** after core garden data graph is connected.

---

# Product Commerce & Treatment Calendar Plan

**Principle:** Products in CRUVIT must **not** be recommended randomly. Every product recommendation must be connected to:

- a specific **plant** (`plantId` / `profileSlug`)
- a specific **care need** / **`treatmentId`**
- **correct timing** (purchase/preparation lead time before use window)
- a **purchase/preparation task**
- a **use/application task**
- **outcome feedback** after use

Schema foundation (committed `416fc78`): `PlantTreatmentDefinition`, linked `purchaseTaskId` / `useTaskId`, `purchaseLeadDays` / `leadDays`, `PlantTreatmentOutcomeFeedbackSpec`, and `onNegativeOutcome` placeholders in `data/plant-catalog.schema.json`. Runtime wiring is future work.

## User Product Outcome Memory (planned)

Per-user memory of how products performed — **not global**. A product that failed for one user may still be valid for others.

### Negative outcome rule

If a product was **not good** for a specific user, CRUVIT must **not** recommend that same product to that user again in the same or similar relevant context.

**Track (per user):**

| Field | Purpose |
|-------|---------|
| `userId` | Owner of the memory |
| `productId` / `shopifyProductId` / `variantId` | Product identity |
| `treatmentId` / `careNeed` | Linked care need |
| `plantId` / `profileSlug` | Linked plant instance or profile |
| plant group | When scope applies to a group |
| condition / diagnosis | When Plant Doctor context applies |
| `outcome` | `didNotHelp` · `worsened` · `badFit` · `userRejected` · `qualityIssue` |
| reason / notes | Optional user or system note |
| `doNotRecommendAgain` | `true` when exclusion applies |
| `createdAt` / `updatedAt` | Audit |
| `scope` | `same_plant` · `same_treatment` · `same_plant_group` · `user_global` (when appropriate) |

**Recommendation rule:** Before showing a product, check the user's outcome/exclusion history. If the product is marked `doNotRecommendAgain` for that user and scope, **do not** show it as the main recommendation — suggest **alternative products for the same care need** instead.

### Positive outcome rule

If a product was marked **excellent/helpful** by a specific user, CRUVIT should **prefer** that product for that same user in future similar situations.

**Track (per user):**

| Field | Purpose |
|-------|---------|
| `outcome` | `excellent` · `helped` · `userPrefers` · `repeatRecommended` |
| `helpedScore` / `satisfactionScore` | When available |
| `repeatRecommendationPreferred` | `true` when user wants repeats |
| related `productId` / `shopifyProductId` / `variantId` | Product identity |
| related `treatmentId` / `careNeed` | Linked care need |
| related `plantId` / `profileSlug` | Linked plant |
| related plant group | Group scope |
| related condition / diagnosis | Diagnosis context |
| `createdAt` / `updatedAt` | Audit |
| `scope` | `same_plant` · `same_treatment` · `same_plant_group` · `user_global` (when appropriate) |

**Recommendation rule:** Before showing a product, check positive outcome history. If the product was previously excellent/helpful for this user and the current care need is similar, **increase its recommendation priority** for that user.

### Safeguards (all product commerce)

- Do **not** recommend products randomly.
- Do **not** recommend a product if there is **no current care need** / active `treatmentId`.
- Still respect **safety**, **timing**, **plant condition**, **environment**, **stock/availability**, and **user preferences**.
- Do **not** fake reviews or product outcomes.
- If **real reviews** exist → show ratings/comments.
- If **no reviews** exist → show **“No user reviews yet”**.
- If the user **does not want** the suggested product → offer **alternative products for the same care need**.

**Implementation order (planned):** Treatment Calendar task runtime → outcome feedback capture on garden `data` → User Product Outcome Memory store → recommendation gate before Shop/care UI → Shopify Smart Connection (phase 13).

# UI/UX Principles

- Premium
- Natural
- Minimal
- Elegant
- Calm
- Consistent

---

# Figma is the Design Authority

The latest approved Figma design is the single source of truth for UI/UX.

If the current implementation differs from the approved Figma design,
the implementation should be updated to match Figma.

Never invent a new layout when an approved Figma design exists.

---

# Development Workflow

Every feature follows this process:

1. Design in Figma.
2. User approves the design.
3. Analyze the existing implementation.
4. Create a small implementation plan.
5. Implement the approved Figma design.
6. Verify desktop and mobile responsiveness.
7. Report changed files.

When implementing Figma:

- Match spacing precisely.
- Match typography.
- Match colors.
- Match hierarchy.
- Match animations when possible.
- Reuse existing components whenever possible.
- Do not rewrite unrelated code.

---

# Technical Debt

_No technical debt items currently tracked._

---

# External Module Integration

When integrating an external working module, especially a ZIP module:

1. Analyze first.
2. Compare with the current Cruvit architecture.
3. Identify dependencies, data models, APIs, and UI entry points.
4. Identify what should be preserved exactly.
5. Identify what may be adapted.
6. Present an integration plan.
7. Wait for user approval.
8. Only then implement incrementally.

Never rewrite a working external module immediately after importing it.

## Plant Doctor (external module specifics)

- The working ZIP version is the protected source.
- Detection logic, API behavior, result quality, and workflow must be preserved.
- UI/UX may be redesigned later from approved Figma.
- Data integration with the shared Cruvit plant database is allowed only with a safe, additive, reversible plan.

(Canonical process rule lives in `AGENTS.md` → "External module integration rule".)

---

# Next Recommended Task

**Read-only planning — choose next small phase (decision pending; do not implement yet).** Location Reliability Enforcement is **done** in `index.html`: Western Galilee / `DEFAULT_GARDEN_LOCATION` is crash-prevention only; trusted location requires `confirmationStatus === 'confirmed'`, `source !== 'default'`, and `locationConfidence !== 'default'`; suitability, Smart Rec scoring/browse, and weather care/refresh are gated until the user confirms a real location (local tests passed). **Choose one for read-only inspection next:** (A) **Confidence-aware scoring refinements** — consume `climateConfidence` / `weatherStatus` for conservative caps when weather is stale or confidence is low (location trust already enforced); (B) **Product/Care Schedule runtime planning** — Treatment Calendar task runtime + outcome feedback wiring plan (must also require trusted location); (C) **Catalog validation / import pipeline planning** — seed validation, import workflow, and quality-tier gates.

> Always keep exactly ONE recommended next task here.
> When the next phase is chosen and planned, replace with the approved implementation task.
